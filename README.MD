Three types in core of design patterns(Gang of Four):

- Creational   => Dealing with Complexity of objects creation 

	- prototype  => Fully initailzed instance to be copied or cloned
	- builder  => Separates the object construction from its representation
	- Singleton => Single instance will be created, who ever request for the object the same instance will be sent => Connection instance
	- Factory = > Create Family of objects. 

 
-Structural    => Structural Dealing with how the classes can be structured

	- Decorator => Add responsibility to the object dynamically
	- Facade  => A single class represents the entire subsystem	
	- Proxy  => Proxy is hiding the complexity of the orginal implementation by providing the proxy of that => EJB Remote
	- Adapter  => Matches interfaces of two different classes
	- Flyweight => Fine grained instace for the efficient usage  => Data base Connection pools
	
- Behavioural  => Behavioural is dealing with how the object behave in a particular situation

	- Chain of responsibility  => way of passing the request between a chain of objects  => Exception handling in Javas
	- Iterator  => sequentially accessing the elements of collections  => Next/previous button in the remote
	- state  => Alter an object behaviour when the state changes
	- Strategy => Go with one strategy and add another strategy later => Collection.comparator#compare
	- Observer  => way of notify the changes in class to no of classes => online biding , notify the bid changes to all the observers
	- Visitor  => Defines a new operation to a class without changing it
	- Template Method  => Defer the extact steps  of an alogrithum  to a subclass  => House plan
	- Command => Encapsulate a command request as an object => All implementation of javan.lang.Runnable
	- Mememto => Capture and restore an object's internal state => Serialization of Java object
	- Mediator => Defines simlified communication between classes =>  ESB => is the example for Mediator
